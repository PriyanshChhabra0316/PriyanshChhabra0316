# Anti-Spoofing Model for Face Recognition Systems

## Project Overview
This project was developed during a hackathon and features a website that provides an advanced Anti-Spoofing Model for Face Recognition Systems. The system ensures secure and reliable user authentication by effectively distinguishing between real and spoofed facial inputs, enhancing the security of face recognition technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV and CVZone**: Utilized for real-time computer vision tasks, allowing the model to analyze and process facial inputs effectively.
- **Ultralytics Library**: Implemented for training the anti-spoofing model, ensuring high accuracy in differentiating between real faces and spoofed inputs.
- **HTML and CSS**: Used for front-end development, creating a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the model.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Analysis**: The model processes facial inputs in real-time, providing immediate feedback on the authenticity of the scanned face.
- **High Accuracy**: Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model achieves a high level of accuracy in identifying spoofed inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The website is designed to be intuitive, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Outcomes
- **Hackathon Achievement**: Successfully secured [2nd place] during the hackathon, showcasing the project's innovation and effectiveness.
- **Collaboration**: Collaborated with team members to brainstorm ideas, develop the model, and present the final product to judges.

## Future Work
- **Enhancements**: Plans to integrate additional features, such as user authentication databases and more advanced machine learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Continuously seeking user feedback to enhance functionality and user experience.
